# Ibiza Survey Application
## Content 
- This application was developed by IBIZA team, where we have 4 students from Business Information Technology department, Haaga Helia University, working nearly 2 months using SCRUM project management methodology. The idea is building a REST API to allow client application (DIGI team) to interact with the server through the HTTP protocol. With a few exceptions, the REST API allows clients to interact with all features of the server, such as reading, creating, and searching resources in the repository.
